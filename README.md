Stix.js
=======

Stix is a jQuery plugin providing a nice and easy to customize inline WYSIWYG editor.
I'm waiting for pull requests!

Fork the code and try it.

To do:
  * Disable buttons when htmleditor is on
  * Image upload via <img src="data-uri"/>
  * Link/Unlink features
  * Usual text type picker (h1,2,3, p, blockquote, code, etc)
  * Font-family & Size selector
  * Color pickers for background and foreground
  * Get awesome ideas!
